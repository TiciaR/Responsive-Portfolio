    <span>About Me</span>
    <div id="container">
        <img src="./Assets/images/Me.jpg">
       <p>I grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. After highschool I studied at Arizona State University, majoring in Art Studies.
           My interests include playing music, creating art and photography. I am a very positive and hard working individual. I'm discovering a new passion for technology and learning
        the language behind it all. I chose to attend the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp as my first step into learning to code. I'm eager to see the opportunities that will come 
        with this new career change.
